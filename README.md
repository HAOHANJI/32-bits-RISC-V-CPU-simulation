# Final project for NYU tandon ECE 6913 Computing System Architecture.
### Simulation of 32 bits RISC-V CPU (Python)	Oct. â€“ Dec. 2022
Implemented the architectures of single-stage processor and five-stage pipelined processor using Python.

Constructed test programs to evaluate the difference of performance factors like CPI, total execution cycle and IPC.

Measured and evaluated multiple performance factors of two implementations.
